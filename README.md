# Mylibrary

### Took my previous Library project made on vanilla Javascript and tried to create full website using React on vite.js on the Frontend and made a server using Express.js and connected a Mongodb to it as a Backend.

##Frontend
### 1. Right now it only access the Admin route on the Backend, still working on the User end.
### 2. Tried to show that i can make simple requests to the server to fetch data from the Backend and display it on the Frontend.

##Backend
### 1. Made routes to give certain actions to Admins and Users.
### 2. Used jsonwebtoken to verify as a middleware on all routes.

### You can access the my account with Username = elwin and Password = 123, or create a new Admin Account.
