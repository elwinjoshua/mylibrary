# Mylibrary

##### Took my previous Library project made on vanilla Javascript and tried to create full website using React on vite.js on the Frontend and made a server using Express.js and connected a Mongodb to it as a Backend.

### Frontend:
###### 1. Added routes only for Admins to add, update details of Books, working on more functions.
###### 3. Deployed the Frontend code on netlify.

### Backend:
###### 1. Made all the routes of Admins and Users, yet to make user implementation on frontend.
###### 2. Used jsonwebtoken to verify credentials to provide access.
###### 3. Deployed Backend code on render

###### You can access the my account with Username = elwin and Password = 123, or create a new Admin Account.
